# Microsoft Internship guide for Caribbean Students

As of 2024, Microsoft now recruits interns from the Caribbean, as a result of the efforts by the [Project Blue Mountain](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/microsoft-day-university-technology-jamaica-thomas-mba-hrm-volie/) team.
The [first cohort](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shoniquethomas_microsoftinterns-microsoftlife-activity-7203425109003403264-laSU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) of Microsoft interns studying in the Caribbean were from Jamaica (University of Technology & University of The West Indies Mona) and Barbados (University of The West Indies Cave Hill). 17 students in total.

We've put together this guide to assist the next groups of interns, from applying and interviewing, to visa concerns.

## Applying for the job
Applications are done on the Microsoft Careers page. Internship roles typically open around November each year. As of writing, not all intern roles are open to the Caribbean, only SWE and TPM.

### Requirements
- Be in university, pursuing a bachelors or masters
- Have atleast 1 semester remaining after the summer (Drop or add courses to qualify if its your last year)

### Timeline
- After applying, you can expect to hear back around 2 weeks, although it can take up to a month for some.
- If you are selected, you will be invited to interview.
  - Interviews are split into multiple rounds with different persons on the same day. Number of rounds may differ by role.
  - Everyone does a behavioural round. For SWE, expect 1 or more technical rounds. You may or may not be asked to code, they care more about your though process.
  - Everything on your resume is fair game for questioning. Know your resume.

## Obtaining a Visa
Yes, Microsoft will assist you in obtaining a J-1 visa to work in the United States. Microsoft uses a third-party (currently Cultural Vistas) to handle this for new hires.
